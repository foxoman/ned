# The source, file by file

Every source file of ned with what it is — the first comment of each file, so a file that says what it is well is described well here. *include N* is the file's place in `src/ned.nim`, which `include`s most files in order (each sees what the ones before it declare: a proc used earlier needs a forward declaration in [`app/forward.nim`](../../src/ned/app/forward.nim)); *module* is a part compiled on its own and imported. The rest belong to `nedls`, `nedfmt` or the plugin library, or are taken in by the module they are part of. [Architecture](architecture.md) says how the parts fit; this page is where to look for one.

Made by `python3 tests/docs/sourcemap.py` from the sources (CI checks it is up to date) — run it after adding, moving or renaming a file.
