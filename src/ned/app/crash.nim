# ── (6.45) when ned itself fails — a fault the program cannot go on from (SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL, SIGABRT:
#    a bug, a stack too deep, memory gone bad) — the terminal is given back as ned found it (its own screen, the
#    mouse and paste modes off, scrolling back), a note says what ned was doing, and the next start says so: the
#    unsaved edits are in the recovery files, which it offers as after any other end. Before, the terminal stayed in
#    ned's modes — no scrolling, mouse codes typed into the shell — and nothing said why. Not on Windows ──
