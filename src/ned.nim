## ned — a fast, safe code editor and Nim IDE for Termux, Linux and macOS (Windows: WSL), in Nim (standard library only).
## It looks and behaves like a desktop editor inside the terminal.
##
##   Termux: pkg install nim git ripgrep curl
##   Build : nim c -d:release --opt:speed -o:$PREFIX/bin/ned src/ned.nim     (Linux: -o:ned)   — or: nimble install
##   Run   : ned [file|folder ...]          (file:line:col and +line work too)
##   Keys  : F10 menus · Ctrl+E command palette · Ctrl+P find file · F1 key bindings
##
##   Nim intelligence is built in: ned's own Nim index (completion with docs, hover, definition, signatures,
##   references, rename, outline) plus nimsuggest from your Nim install (types it cannot infer, live errors,
##   inlay hints). nimlangserver is optional ("nim.ide": "nimlangserver"). Nim formatting is built in too
##   (nph's style, checked); nph or nimpretty can be chosen instead ("nim.formatter").
##
##   Optional: nimble install inim            → Nim REPL in the terminal
##             pkg install gdb                → Nim: debug with gdb
##             pkg install termux-api (+ the Termux:API app) → system clipboard
##             export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=…     → AI assistant (or OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama … see settings)
##
## Title bar with menus, docks (files, search & replace, git, Nim, tests · assistant, outline, timeline),
## tabs, split editor, breadcrumbs, minimap, bottom panel (problems, output, terminal), toasts, dialogs and
## context menus; integrated terminal (pty); AI chat + agent with diff approvals, saved chats, slash
## commands and inline suggestions; Vim mode; 42 themes; one commented settings file (plus per-project
## settings) with every option, including all nimlangserver settings; a built-in Nim engine and formatter;
## multi-cursor editing, regex find/replace, project-wide replace, folding, inlay hints, quick fixes
## (std imports, unused imports), test explorer, git changes/blame, bookmarks; crash-safe saves, recovery
## files and local history.
