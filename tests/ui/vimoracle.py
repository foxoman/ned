"""A real vim as ned's oracle: the same file, the same keys — where vim's cursor, text and register end up.

vim runs headless (`nvim -es`, or `vim`, whichever is on PATH) with a small script: it puts the cursor where a case
starts, gives it the case's keys (`feedkeys(..., 'xt')`, which reads them as normal-mode keys and waits for each), and
writes down what the state was after them — the line, the column, the whole text, the unnamed register and whether it
was linewise, and the visual mode. Nothing is timed and nothing is read from a screen, so a case answers the same thing
every run: 300 cases take a few seconds, not minutes.

    o = Oracle()
    o.need()                        # the UI suite's Skip when there is no vim to ask
    a = o.ask('d j', 1, 1, path=f)  # one case: what vim left behind, as a dict
    o.answers(cases, path, cache)   # many (keys, line, col) cases, kept in a JSON file while vim is the same

An answer's `col` is vim's own `col('.')`: on a line that starts with a tab it counts the tab's display columns, where
ned's status bar counts characters — `vimcases.vcol` turns one into the other.

    python3 tests/ui/vimoracle.py --json OUT    # every case of vimcases.py, answered by vim, written to OUT

Exit status: 0 when every case answered, 2 when there is no vim, 1 when one case did not answer.
