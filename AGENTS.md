# Working on ned — for AI agents (and people)

ned is a terminal code editor and Nim IDE written in Nim, standard library only. Read
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [docs/guide/building.md](docs/guide/building.md) for the long version; this
page is what an agent needs to change ned safely. How each part works, recipes and pitfalls:
[docs/dev](docs/dev/README.md).

## Build

```sh
nim c -d:release --opt:speed -d:strip -o:ned src/ned.nim        # the editor (about 7 minutes)
nim c -d:release --opt:speed -d:strip -o:nedfmt src/nedfmt.nim  # the formatter on its own
nim c -d:release -o:nedls src/nedls.nim                         # the Nim engine as a language server
nim c -d:release --hints:off --compileOnly:on src/ned.nim       # a quick check that it compiles (about 2 minutes)
nim c --stackTrace:on --lineTrace:on -o:ned_debug src/ned.nim   # with stack traces (the fuzzer uses it)
```

On Linux and macOS `src/ned.nims` builds on the system's memory allocator (`-d:useMalloc`) and `src/ned/sys/heap.nim`
gives back what is no longer used; on Android and Windows, Nim's (`-d:nedNimAlloc`: Nim's everywhere). Measure memory
with each before and after a change that holds much: [Memory](docs/dev/architecture.md#memory).

Nim 2.2.4 or newer — test with the oldest and the newest: GitHub builds with 2.2.4 too (Linux and Windows' WSL; its
standard library differs in places — `posix.signal` returns nothing there), and its checks (and Termux) use the newest, 2.4,
whose C names (`shout_u0__app`), `#line`s, coverage lines, NIF and nimsuggest differ from 2.2's (the engine scoreboard
keeps 2.2's nimsuggest as its yardstick; what else differs: [pitfalls](docs/dev/pitfalls.md#nim-24-is-not-nim-22)).
For the UI suite with 2.4, build ned with it and put it first on PATH. A build whose debug information ned reads goes
through `nimDebugBuildCmd`. Cross builds need zig (`pip install ziglang`): `tests/build/termux.sh` (the Termux `.deb`),
`tests/build/windows.sh` (the Windows zip), `tests/build/cross.sh` (every target). Pass `-g0` to `zig cc` (the
scripts do): with debug information, ned's biggest C file needs more than 6 GB to compile.

## How the source is put together

[docs/dev/source-map.md](docs/dev/source-map.md) lists every source file, folder by folder, with what it is
and where it comes in the include order — the place to find a part.

- `src/ned.nim` `include`s most files in order — each sees what the files before it declare. A proc used before
  the file that defines it is included needs a forward declaration in `src/ned/app/forward.nim` (look there
  first: it may exist already, and a second one is an error).
- Some parts are modules of their own (compiled separately, imported): the Nim index (`src/ned/nim/index`), the
  formatters, the regular expressions, `core/text`, the C index, `editor/asmview`, `editor/binfmt` …
  `tests/ui`'s formatter self-test merges every file and module into one — two modules may not both define the
  same top-level name.
- ned's own plugins are in `plugins/<name>/plugin.nims` (off until turned on in the Plugins dock), read into ned when
  it is built — a change to one needs a new build to show in the editor. Their list is `PlugBundledNames` in
  `src/ned/plugins/host.nim`; each has its checks in `tests/plugins/bundled/test_<name>.py`.
- Settings: `defS(…)` in `src/ned/config/settings.nim`, with a description a person can act on. Commands:
  `add(…)` in `src/ned/app/commandlist.nim` (and the menus in `src/ned/ui/menubar.nim`). The plugin API:
  `src/ned/plugins/lib/nedplugin.nim` and `nedlsp.nim`, every exported proc with a `##` doc comment.
- **Closures made in a loop share the loop's variables** — a `let` copy inside the loop too. Every menu item, job
  callback or button made in a loop then acts on the last iteration's value. Use a factory proc
  (`proc act(v: T): Action = (proc() = use(v))`) or `capture v:` (std/sugar; inside it `result` is the lambda's
  own, so collect into a local variable).
- `nim check` and the engine must see what ned sees: a plugin's source gets `--path:` to the plugin library, an
  included file is checked through the module that includes it.

A UI test that fails only on GitHub: run it with the runner's tools (Nim 2.4 on PATH, the language servers in
`NED_TEST_PATH`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`, `NED_UI_FULL=1`) — see [What the machine has](docs/dev/pitfalls.md#what-the-machine-has).

A change to a setting or a command: `ned --doc-settings > docs/reference/settings.md` and `ned --doc-commands >
docs/reference/commands.md` (with an empty `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so no one's settings get in); to the plugin API:
`python3 tests/docs/apiref.py`; a file added, moved or renamed: `python3 tests/docs/sourcemap.py`. CI fails when they
are out of date. A UI test is a `t_<version>_<topic>` function in `tests/ui/suite.py`, added to the `tests` list at
its end; it drives keys and mouse clicks (`click(x, y)`, columns and rows from 1) and reads the screen back. Run the
UI suite on a quiet machine: under load a few timing-sensitive tests can fail, and pass alone.

## Write

- Documentation lives in `docs/` (the README is an overview). Plain words: say what happens for the person using
  ned, not how it is implemented; British spelling as the rest; no marketing.
- Every file starts with a comment saying what it is, and every routine (proc, func, method, iterator, converter,
  template, macro — local ones too) says what it does and how: a `##` first in its body, or a `#` line above a
  one-line one. `python3 tests/docs/comments.py` checks it (CI too); `--list` shows what is missing.
- Comments say why, in the same plain style. Keep a change small and in the style of the code around it.
- Screenshots (`screenshots/`): every one is drawn from its tmux capture (`screenshots/captures/NAME.ansi`) in the
  Coder Nerd Font Mono by `tests/shots/render.py` — a new one too, never a screen grab
  ([Screenshots](docs/dev/testing.md#screenshots)).
- A release: the version in `src/ned/version.nim`, `ned.nimble`, `editors/vscode/package.json`,
  `editors/zed/extension.toml` and `editors/zed/Cargo.toml` (and the file names in the README), a
  *What's new* section at the top of the README (the one before moves to CHANGELOG.md), every test above passing.
  CI only checks that ned builds everywhere and publishes nothing: `ned --update` and `install.sh` build the newest
  tag with nimble; the Termux package (`tests/build/termux.sh`) is attached to the GitHub release by hand, with the
  `SHA256SUMS` the script writes beside it (install.sh and `ned --update` refuse a package the release has no sums for).
  `editors/zed` is also its own repository, [foxoman/nedls-zed](https://github.com/foxoman/nedls-zed): keep the two
  the same.
